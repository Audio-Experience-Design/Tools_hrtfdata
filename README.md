# hrtfdata
HRTF data management focussed on deep learning

## Installation

The `hrtfdata` package is configured to be installable with `pip`, but because of its premature state, no releases are made and pushed to PyPI yet. Instead, you should install it in "editable mode" with the following procedure.

- `git clone https://github.com/jpauwels/hrtfdata/`
- `cd hrtfdata`
- `pip install [--user] -e .`

You can then simply update the package by calling `git pull` whenever the repo has been updated or even make your own edits and start contributing.
